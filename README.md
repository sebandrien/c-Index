Academic Record Serach- Implements a system for managing student data, course enrollments, and grades by using data strucutes, file handling and command validation.

Armstrong Numbers- Finds all armstrong  numbers to a given number n.

Average Score- Calculates the average of 5 academic grades.

Display Array-

Intro- Introduction print statement program for computer science course.

Letter Grade- Reads data and calculates letter grade and has lookup functions.

Linked List Selection- Has a menu of options to modify a linked list.

Linked Stack- A simple implementation of a stack data structure in C using a linked list. It allows users to perform stack operations interactively, such as pushing values onto the stack, popping values off the stack, viewing the top value, checking if the stack is empty, and displaying the entire stack.

Merge Sort-  Demonstrates Merge Sort, a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach.

Odometer- Simulates a driving experience, updating the odometer and fuel gauge based on the user's input for distance and fuel efficiency (miles per gallon).

Queue Linked List- Implements a circular queue using a linked list, where each node contains an integer (data) and a pointer to the next node. It provides functions to add elements to the queue (enqueue), remove elements from the queue (dequeue), check if the queue is empty (empty), display the elements in the queue (display), and show the front element (front).

Reader- Reads and interprets a given character inputed by a user.

Reverse Number- Takes a five-digit integer as input, reverses the digits of that number, and calculates the sum of the digits. 

Scholarly Reader-  Implementation of a merge sort algorithm combined with a custom logic to find the maximum sum of pages under certain constraints.

String Processing- Implements multiple functions for a given string such as str_copy(), isPlaindrome() and capitalize_word().

Swap- Prompts the user to enter two integers, checks for valid input, and then swaps the values of these integers.

Temperature Converter- Converts a float input n, to celsius measurement.

Tree Trace- This program calculates the maximum Euclidean distance between pairs of points stored in two-dimensional arrays, specifically designed for trees with up to TREEMAX nodes.

Triangle Inversion -
